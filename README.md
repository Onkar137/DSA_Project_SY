Huffman Encoding/Decoding Project

Overview
This project implements a file compression and decompression utility using the Huffman encoding/decoding algorithm. Huffman coding is a widely used technique in data compression to achieve efficient encoding of data.

Features
File Compression: Reduces file sizes using Huffman encoding.
File Decompression: Recovers original files from Huffman encoded data.
Efficient Algorithms: Implemented optimal Huffman encoding and decoding algorithms.
User Interface: Simple and intuitive command-line interface for file compression and decompression operations.

Technologies Used
C
